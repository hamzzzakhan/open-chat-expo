# Privacy Policy for Open Chat

Last updated: July 25, 2025

## Overview
Open Chat is a simple utility app that helps users start WhatsApp conversations without saving phone numbers to their contacts. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Information We Collect
Open Chat does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal information. Specifically:

- **Phone Numbers**: Phone numbers entered in the app are processed locally on your device only. They are not stored, transmitted to our servers, or shared with any third parties.
- **Personal Data**: We do not collect names, email addresses, or any other personal information.
- **Usage Analytics**: We do not collect analytics or usage data.
- **Device Information**: We do not access or collect device information.

## How the App Works
1. You enter a phone number in the app
2. The app formats the number locally on your device
3. The app opens WhatsApp with the formatted number
4. No data is stored or transmitted by our app

## Third-Party Services
The app uses WhatsApp's URL scheme to open conversations. When you tap "Open in WhatsApp," you are redirected to WhatsApp's app or website. Please refer to WhatsApp's privacy policy for information about their data practices.

## Data Security
Since we don't collect any data, there is no data to secure. All phone number processing happens locally on your device.

## Children's Privacy
Our app does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the app and on our website.
